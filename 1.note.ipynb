    "**Redis** and **Celery** are not the same, but they are often used together.\n",

    "### **What is Redis?**\n",
    "- **Redis** is an **in-memory data store** that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.\n",
    "- It is **fast** because it stores data in memory instead of on disk.\n",
    "- It supports **publish/subscribe messaging**, making it useful as a **message broker** for distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Celery?**\n",
    "- **Celery** is a **task queue** that allows you to run background jobs asynchronously.\n",
    "- It helps offload **long-running or scheduled tasks** (e.g., sending emails, processing large files).\n",
    "- It needs a **message broker** to store and distribute tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How do Redis and Celery work together?**\n",
    "- **Celery** uses **Redis** as a message broker to **queue** and **distribute** tasks to workers.\n",
    "- When you enqueue a task in Celery, it is stored in **Redis**.\n",
    "- Celery **workers** pull tasks from Redis and execute them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Setup**\n",
    "If you are using **Celery with Redis**, you typically start:\n",
    "1. **Redis server** (to act as a broker)\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   redis-server\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Celery worker** (to process tasks)\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   celery -A my_project worker --loglevel=info\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Add tasks to Celery** (from your Python code)\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from my_project.tasks import add\n",
    "   result = add.delay(2, 3)  # Task sent to Redis, Celery worker picks it up\n",
    "   print(result.get())  # Retrieves the result after execution\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- **Redis is a message broker**, and **Celery is a task queue**.\n",
    "- Celery can use Redis as a **backend** to store task results.\n",
    "- You often run **both Redis and Celery together** in a distributed task-processing system.\n",
