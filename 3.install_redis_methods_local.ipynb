    "1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows**:  \n",
    "   - Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).\n",
    "   - Enable **WSL 2** backend during installation.\n",

    "There is a **unofficial** Windows port of Redis maintained by Memurai.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Memurai (Redis for Windows)**:  \n",
    "   - Visit [Memurai](https://www.memurai.com/download) and download the free version.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install and Run Redis**:\n",
    "   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
